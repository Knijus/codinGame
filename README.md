# Coding game solutions
## **About CodinGame**

**CodinGame** is an online platform for developers, allowing them to play with programming with increasingly difficult puzzles, to learn to code better with an online programming application supporting twenty-five programming languages, and to compete in multiplayer programming contests involving timed artificial intelligence, or code golf challenges.

## **This project**
Recently I have started to learn programing. I have learned teoretical knowledge of how to use sertain methods, loops, conditions and etc, but wasn`t quite sure how to use them in practise. 

*CodinGame* was the place, where I was able to try myself with different puzzles. 

Sometimes I find myself some difficulties with finding the right way to complete all testcases and ended up googling. My searches weren`t always 100% succesful, so I came up with the idea to share my solutions to help others like me.

## **Content** 
All folders consists with: 
- index.js - solution for certain puzzle;
- README - puzzle`s description;
- Test case scenarios and unit tests for puzzle
